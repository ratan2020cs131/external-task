                    Here you can import studentsâ€™ assignments so that they can use AI to intelligently query their work in the 1UP mobile app. Students can provide access to their AI interactivity history allowing you to understand the issues they are trying to understand more deeply. Interactive participation with your students and their AI forums can be enabled in this tab. You should encourage your students to use AI to query their work, and support them in developing the complexity of their questioning, all of which you can do from here.
